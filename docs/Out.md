## Authentication

### Key Features
- **App Passwords**: 
  - Secure authentication mechanism built with Django. Users can create and manage app-specific passwords for secure access to the platform. These passwords are uniquely generated and used in place of the main login credentials for added security. 
  - **App Password Flow**: Users can generate app passwords through the platform's settings interface, which are stored securely in the database and hashed using Django's password hashing algorithms.
  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - **Patient**: Patients have access to personalized recommendations, trends, health records, and AI-driven insights. This includes interaction with their health profiles, recommendations for medication, diet, and lifestyle changes.
  - **Admin**: Admin users can manage the platform's overall configuration, including user management, health trends, data processing, and system-level settings. Admins have broader privileges to view and modify sensitive data.
  - **Additional Roles** (Optional): Future role types like "Healthcare Provider" or "Moderator" can be added to the system to allow for more customized user experiences.

- **Token-Based Authentication**:
  - **JWT Tokens**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used to authenticate users. Once a user logs in, a JWT is generated and returned to the frontend, which is stored securely and used in subsequent API requests. The token contains user identification, role, and permissions.
  - **App Password Tokens**: When users authenticate using app passwords, the platform generates a separate app-specific JWT, limiting access to only app functionalities and reducing exposure of sensitive data. 
  - **Token Expiration & Refresh**: JWT tokens are issued with expiration times to enforce security, typically 1 hour for access tokens and 24 hours for refresh tokens. The refresh tokens are securely stored and can be used to obtain a new access token when needed, without requiring the user to log in again.
  
- **Password Security**:
  - All passwords, including app passwords and user account passwords, are securely hashed using Django's built-in `PBKDF2` password hashing algorithm. This ensures that even in the case of a data breach, passwords remain secure.

### Authentication Flow

1. **Signup**:
   - New users create accounts using a secure registration form. Required fields include username, email, and a strong password. The system validates these fields and ensures that the username and email are unique.
   - Upon successful registration, the user’s information is stored securely, and an email is sent for account verification.

2. **Login**:
   - **Email & Password**: The user logs in using their email and password. If the login is successful, a JWT is generated and returned to the client, which is then used for authenticating all subsequent API requests.
   - **App Passwords**: Alternatively, users may choose to authenticate with app passwords for better security. App passwords are used to generate specific access tokens for each app. This allows more granular control over which apps can access the system.

3. **Role Assignment**:
   - During onboarding, users are assigned a default role based on their information. Patients are automatically assigned the "Patient" role, while admins are assigned the "Admin" role.
   - Role assignments can be adjusted by system admins in the backend, giving flexibility in managing user permissions.

4. **Session Validation**:
   - Every API request that requires authentication includes the JWT token in the request headers. The middleware verifies the validity of the token, ensuring that the user is authenticated and authorized to perform the requested actions.
   - If the token is expired, the user will need to authenticate again, or use a valid refresh token to obtain a new access token.

5. **Logout**:
   - When the user logs out, their session is invalidated. This can be done by either deleting the stored token on the client-side or by sending a request to the backend to blacklist the token for additional security.

6. **Token Management**:
   - Users have the option to view and manage their tokens in the app settings. They can revoke old or unused tokens to ensure that no unauthorized access occurs in case of device compromise.
   - This allows for increased transparency and control over personal data security.
